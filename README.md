## 2D Square Ising Model on Julia

That's a naive implementation of a 2D Square Ising Model using Julia and some of its packages (Gadfly.jl and DataFrames.jl)

It's more of an educational project to myself (based on some 'home exam' that I had to do) than a notorius implementation.

Now it's on a phase of optimization, so if you have any suggestions feel free to comment on an issue
